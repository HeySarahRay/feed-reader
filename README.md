# RSS Feed Reader Project

### Mission
For this project, we roleplayed as developers who take over the job of testing applications for someone who has left the company. We fortunately had [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to help us break code and appropriately fix it.

### Want to run the code yourself?
* Clone/download this repository
* Open in text editor
* Open index.html to your browser
* Check the bottom of the page to see "specs" and "failures".
* Feel free to play around with the code and see if you are able to fix the failures.
